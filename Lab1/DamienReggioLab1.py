Hello World!
My family name is Reggio
My G number is: G01244199

Syllabus detail 1: We will be working with a MySQL Database, I will need
to figure out how to run that without administrative privileges, perhaps
google cloud shell or something similar.

Syllabus detail 2: I need to be careful when helping others in the forum
so I am not too specific with answers.

Coding Standards detail 1: A side effect of limiting code to 79 lines is
that over nesting is difficult to do.

Coding Standards detail 2: camelCase is very ingraned in my variable
naming, it will take some effort to switch to lower_with_under

Coding Standards detail 3: I'm unclear on proper spacing (align with
opening or 4 space indent), I will consult PEP8, it looks like they are
both acceptable
